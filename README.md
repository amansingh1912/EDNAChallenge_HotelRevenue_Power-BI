It is a Hotel Revenue Analysis of EDNA Challenge 22.

## Overview:

* I was provided one excel file with different year data and workbooks of 2018, 2019 and 2020. But, I clubbed them up and made a new workbook named "Full Dataset" 
which includes all the rows of the data.

* The sheet contains several columns like Hotel Type, is_canceled, lead_time, arrival_date_year, arrival_date_month, stays in weeks and weekend nights, avg daily rate, 
adults, babies,children, etc.

After loading dataset in Power BI, I applied the following applications:

## Steps taken In Power BI Application:

# Theme and Color Palette:

* First of all, I chose a color palette for the dashboard which included black, green, brown, orange and blue.

# Dataset Applications of DAX in Power BI:

I applied some DAX measures inside the dataset like DISTINCTCOUNT, SUM, CALCULATE measures to get the desired mathematical values in either percentages or whole 
numbers.

# Visualization and parameters used:

* From visualization point of view, I thought here to go with 3 paged dashboard with horizontal navigation panes containing 3 pages which are of "Agent Profile", "Guests Profile", "KPI Indicators".

* In KPI indicators, I used 4 criteria here which are "Cancellations", "Lead Time", "Repeated Guests" and "Stays in Weeks and Weekends w.r.t to Reservation Date".
It overall gave a nice picture in terms of various aspects like age categories, country, etc. 

* I used 4 filters in the report which were "Reservation Year", "Hotel Type", "Distribution Type" and "Customer Type" and used them as side pane.


## Key Insights and Recommendations from the Report:

* August has most number of check-outs over the period of 3 years.
* July has most number of cancelled reservations over the period of 3 years.
* Agent 9 contributed most to the revenue and his/her pay could be increased if the management would like to consider on it.
* Total Adults has been the highest among all guests who stayed at hotel.
* Portugal is the country where most number of people stayed at hotel.
* Transient Customer type is among the highest customer type.
* Most number of cancelled reservations are from adults and least from babies.
* Average Lead time is highest for the month of July.


## Conclusion:
Overall, it was nice dataset to work around and loved to visualize and come up with insights.
